        GreenWear is a non-profit that addresses the challenges faced by families with limited financial resources, refugees, and low-income households in obtaining affordable school uniforms. By collecting used uniforms from schools and selling them at a fraction of the original cost, GreenWear aims to provide access to quality uniforms while supporting sustainability and social inclusion. The revenue generated will be reinvested in the platform, shared with schools, and used to further subsidize costs for vulnerable communities.
